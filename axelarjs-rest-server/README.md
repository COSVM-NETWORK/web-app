## Commands
dev:tsc starts the compiler in watch mode, meaning it watches for any changes and automatically rebuilds.

dev:serve uses nodemon to automatically reload the server when the Javascript changes.

dev uses npm-run-all to run both commands at the same time, so you don't have to have two terminals open.
